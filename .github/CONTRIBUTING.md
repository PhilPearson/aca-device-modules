## How to contribute to ACAEngine device modules

#### **Did you find a bug?**

*   **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/acaprojects/aca-device-modules/issues).

*   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/acaprojects/aca-device-modules/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring.

*   If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

*   Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

*   Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Have you written a new device module?**

*   Thank you, you're awesome.

*   Make sure you have test cases that mock the physical device (and pass).

*   Include a link to the device control protocol that is publicly accessible and does not require a vendor log in to access.

*   All incoming changes will need to pass code style and complexity static analysis prior to being merged. When submitting a PR this will be shown as an automated check. You can also verify compliance at any time locally using the [Code Climate CLI](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate).


#### **Do you have another question?**

*   Come say hi - developer@acaprojects.com.
